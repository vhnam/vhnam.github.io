      "description": "Working with SingTel to facilitate HungryGoWhere’s expansion into Malaysia, the HungryGoWhere Malaysia app was conceived to leverage on the success of the local HungryGoWhere brand name in Singapore. The successful collaboration resulted in the crystallization of a mobile app and website that fuses traditional and social media elements of food discovery.<br />Hungry Go Where Malaysia was launched in August 2013, to much fanfare (including a new world record), and was in <strong>Apple’s top 20 Lifestyle apps</strong> not long after.<br />Update: Hungry Go Where Malaysia has been restructured back into the Hungry Go Where branding and is no longer available on the Apple or Play stores."
